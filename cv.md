## An example of task solving
**Task:** function should return true if the input number is narcisstic. A Narcissistic Number is a positive number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base.(*Task was taken from Codewars, you can find my account: [alenamor7](https://www.codewars.com/users/alenamor7)*) <br/>
**Solution:**
```javascript
function narcissistic(value) {
  const valueString = value.toString();
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < valueString.length; i++) {
    sum += Math.pow(valueString[i], valueString.length);
  }
  if(parseInt(sum) === value) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}
```
